# Streams

## Stream components

A Stream is composed of 3 main parts :

1. First part is the source part, it contains our data like list, arrayList, hashMap and many other.
2. Second part are operations they can be either intermediate or terminal.
    1. Intermediate operations : such as filter, map or sort return a stream so we can chain multiple 
    intermediate operations.
    2. Terminal operations : such as forEach, collect or reduce are either void or return a non-stream 
    result.
